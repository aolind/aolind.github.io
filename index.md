### About Me

Here is **Aolin Ding**. I am a Research Associate Principal in [<font color='0074cc'>Accenture Labs</font>](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-labs-index). I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>Rutgers University</font>](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) in 2022 under the guidance of [<font color='0074cc'>Prof. Saman Zonouz</font>](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz) â€“ who is now at Georgia Tech. Before that, I had a multicultural undergraduate study, spending my four-year bachelor life across three universities: UESTC, I-Shou, and Rutgers. I received my B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>UESTC</font>](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2015.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on the security of cyber-physical systems, industrial IoT, and embedded systems. In these domains, I leverage a combination of software analysis, physics-based monitoring, and learning-based approaches to develop innovative security solutions. At Accenture, my interest extends to applied AI for cybersecurity, particularly in addressing security challenges through emerging techniques that are recently possible and likely to be impactful in the near future. This includes work with large language models (LLMs), privacy-preserving machine learning, and virtual reality.

I am always enthusiastic about contributing to the security research community. I have a solid record of [<font color='0074cc'>publications</font>](https://aolind.github.io/publications/) and professional services at leading security conferences.
