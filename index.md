### About Me

Here is **Aolin Ding**. I am a Research Associate Principal in [<font color='0074cc'>Accenture Labs</font>](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-labs-index). I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>Rutgers University</font>](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) in 2022 under the guidance of [<font color='0074cc'>Prof. Saman Zonouz</font>](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz) â€“ who is now at Georgia Tech. During my Ph.D., I interned and worked with many distinguished researchers at Accenture and MERL. Prior to that, I had a multicultural undergraduate study, spending my four-year bachelor life across three universities: UESTC, I-Shou, and Rutgers. I received my B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>UESTC</font>](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2015.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on the **`security`** of **cyber-physical systems**, **industrial IoT**, and **embedded systems**. In these domains, I leverage a combination of software analysis, physics-based monitoring, and machine learning approaches to develop innovative security solutions. At Accenture, my interest extends to applied AI for cybersecurity, particularly in addressing security challenges through emerging techniques, including large language models (LLMs), privacy-preserving machine learning, and virtual reality.

I am always enthusiastic about contributing to the security research community. I have a solid record of [<font color='0074cc'>publications</font>](https://aolind.github.io/publications/) and [<font color='0074cc'>professional services</font>](https://aolind.github.io/services/) at leading security conferences.
