### About Me

Here is **Aolin Ding**. I am an AI Research Scientist at Accenture’s Center for Advanced AI. As the Security Tech Lead, I lead a security team developing [<font color='0074cc'>AI Refinery</font>](https://airefinery.accenture.com/) and [<font color='0074cc'>its SDK</font>](https://sdk.airefinery.accenture.com/ai_refinery_101/) — an industry AI platform that unifies AI models, agents, and knowledge systems. My team created one of the world’s first successful [<font color='0074cc'>jailbreaks</font>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12893) of large reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1/o3) in collaboration with university partners. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate Principal at Accenture Labs, where I focused on AI safety, LLM security, PII protection, and privacy-preserving ML.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>Rutgers University</font>](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) in 2022 under the guidance of [<font color='0074cc'>Prof. Saman Zonouz</font>](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz) – who is now at Georgia Tech. I previously worked as a Research Intern at Accenture Labs and MERL for over a year. Prior to my Ph.D., I had a multicultural undergraduate study, spending my four-year bachelor life across three universities: UESTC, I-Shou, and Rutgers. I received my B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>UESTC</font>](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2015.

### Research Interests

- At Accenture, my research focuses on building secure, responsible and scalable **`multi-agent`** systems powered by **LLMs**. I specialize in agentic testing, evaluation, assessment and tooling of foundation model-based agents, with focus areas of safety, compliance, privacy, and security.

- In parallel, I actively advance my PhD research in the **`security`** of **cyber-physical systems**, **industrial IoT**, and **embedded systems**. In these domains, I leverage a combination of software analysis, physics-based monitoring, and machine learning approaches to develop innovative security solutions.

I have a solid record of [<font color='0074cc'>publications</font>](https://aolind.github.io/publications/) and [<font color='0074cc'>professional services</font>](https://aolind.github.io/services/) at leading AI and security conferences and journals.
