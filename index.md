## About Me

Here is **Aolin Ding**. I am a Research Associate Principal in [<font color='0074cc'>Accenture Labs</font>](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-labs-index). My research focuses on the security of cyber-physical systems, industrial IoT, and embedded systems through software analysis, physics-based monitoring, and data-driven assessment. I also develop a passion for AI security research, such as generative AI, privacy-preserving ML, and virtual reality. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>Rutgers University</font>](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) in 2022 under the guidance of [<font color='0074cc'>Prof. Saman Zonouz</font>](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz) â€“ who is now at Georgia Tech. I received my B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>UESTC</font>](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2015.
