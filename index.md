### About Me

Here is **Aolin Ding**. I am an AI Research Scientist at Accenture Center for Advanced AI. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>Rutgers University</font>](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) in 2022 under the guidance of [<font color='0074cc'>Prof. Saman Zonouz</font>](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz) â€“ who is now at Georgia Tech. During my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Intern at Accenture and MERL for over a year. Prior to that, I had a multicultural undergraduate study, spending my four-year bachelor life across three universities: UESTC, I-Shou, and Rutgers. I received my B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from [<font color='0074cc'>UESTC</font>](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2015.

### Research Interests

At Accenture, my research focuses on building secure, responsible and scalable **`multi-agent`** systems powered by LLMs. I specialize in agentic testing, evaluation, assessment and tooling of foundation model-based agents, with focus areas of safety, compliance, privacy, and security.

In parallel, I continue to advance my PhD research in the **`security`** of **cyber-physical systems**, **industrial IoT**, and **embedded systems**. In these domains, I leverage a combination of software analysis, physics-based monitoring, and machine learning approaches to develop innovative security solutions.

I have a solid record of [<font color='0074cc'>publications</font>](https://aolind.github.io/publications/) and [<font color='0074cc'>professional services</font>](https://aolind.github.io/services/) at leading AI and security conferences and journals.
